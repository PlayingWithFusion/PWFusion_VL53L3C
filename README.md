Playing With Fusion VL53L3C time of flight sensor library
=========================================================

![SEN-36007-L3 ISO](http://www.playingwithfusion.com/include/getimg.php?imgid=1488)

Arduino wrapper built on top of the ST VL53L3C C API.  This time of flight (ToF) sensor improves on previous sensors from ST and is able to track up to four targets simultaneously. It utilizes an invisible class 1 laser to measure absolute distance regardless of the target color or reflectance. The maximum sample rate and ranging distance is dependent on ambient lighting conditions (1.4 meters in short mode, 3 meters in long mode).
